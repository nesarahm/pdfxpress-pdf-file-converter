## Instructions

### Instructions for Installing and Configuring the System
#### Step 1: Download the Files
To get started, you first need to download the corresponding system files. Once downloaded, unzip them to your server or project folder.

#### Step 2: Upload the Files to the Server
Upload all the files to your server. Once uploaded, the system will be ready to use. No additional configuration is required for it to work.

#### Step 3: Ad Configuration
To configure ads, you need to edit the ads.php file found in the downloaded files. In this file, you will need to paste the code provided by Google AdSense.

#### Step 4: Create a Google AdSense Account (if you don't have one)
If you don't have a Google AdSense account yet, you can create one on their official site. Once you have your account, Google will provide you with an ad code that you need to paste into the ads.php file.

#### Step 5: Place the Ads on Your Page
You can place the ads wherever you want on your page. To do this, simply include the following code in the location where you want the ad to appear:
```php
<?php 
include "ads.php"; 
?>
```        
This code will include the AdSense ad wherever you place it on your page.

#### Ready to Generate Revenue!
Once you've set up the ads, your system will be ready to generate revenue. Just make sure the ads are properly placed and that your site has adequate traffic to generate income through AdSense.

Enjoy your system and the income generated!
